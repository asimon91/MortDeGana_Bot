# Mel De Bot

Mel de bot covers poll needs from a bot. It has 3 funcs by the moment:

## Party Poll

Makes the question: "Who is coming?". The user may add extra text befor sending the poll. The options are: 
  - "Mel!", which is an afirmative answer. By default it will add the user as "MEL". If the user wishes, he can vote for more ppl (extra company like g/bfs) by adding some text after the /mel.
  - "Moto!", which is a negative answer. This one also sends a motorbike crash gif from giphy.

_Usage:_

```
/poll [extra text]
/mel  [extra text]
/moto
```

>TODO: ADD a GIF showing usage

## Mel!

Just send a random GIF. It uses a 100 random seed with one of the following search words (decided randomly): "honey, party, smile, laugh, crash, fall, funny"

## Spam prevention

In order to avoid spam by other bot commands, repeated messages will be erased. Also warns the admins of this behaviour.
