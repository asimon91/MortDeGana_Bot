# Git-wise
## Be clear in your code and your commits

Try to use atomic commits with a clear description. Capitalize the first letter of the commit message and add a dot at the end.
Doesn't fit? Please use the description standard (leave a blank line and then add a longer description).
Really long descriptions should be placed as comments in your PR, not in the commit label.

## PRs should follow an issue and/or the PR template

Are you implementing any new feature? Probably you will need to fork this repo, and then do the PR towards this remote.

Please link your PR to one of the existing issues (or create a new one).
If there is no issue, please describe the PR according to the Pull Request template available (should appear in your GitHub UI when you create the PR)

# Code-wise

## Code styling

We want to follow PEP8, you can run the check.sh (or just check it to see what it does) in order to run black on all the python files of the repo.
Black will take care of all the styling for you and the code will look neat!

## Using types in Python

Yes, we know it's not something required, but it is for us.
It's not something present in the whole code (yet). However **all new code should be typed**.

## Found bugs while coding ?

- Are they minor bugs? -> Solve them in your PR
- Are they out of scope or you don't know how? -> Add the bug/help wanted labels and we'll check them and decide what to do with it

# Attitude-wise

## Be respectfull

Do not harass or say (type, send...) anything offensive with mean intent to any member of this project or it's contributors.

Teaching and learning is part of life, if you see this kind of behavior please tag the owner, we'll try to correct it.
Have a chat with the affected parties and reach an understanding.
